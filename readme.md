# Happy Plan! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kud/happy-plan.png)](https://travis-ci.org/kud/happy-plan)

> When Grunt.js uses Jekyll as a peon.

Happy plan is bundle of amazing tools to be used as a static website generator. It's all about fun and so easy to publish on [gh-pages](http://pages.github.com/).

### What in it?

* A static website generator from html or markdown: [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
* A task-based command line build tool: [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) & some pre-defined tasks (scripts, styles & images automatic compression).
* An amazing CSS pre-processor, Sass directly served with [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).
* A quick way to provide scalable icons as font thanks to [Fontcustom](http://fontcustom.com/) & a Grunt task.
* A [Livereload](http://livereload.com/) server ([tiny-lr](https://github.com/mklabs/tiny-lr)) to make development as fast as hell.
* A package manager for the web called [Bower](https://github.com/twitter/bower).

Oh, by the way, [why "happy plan"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zVVKXT8Vi0)?
