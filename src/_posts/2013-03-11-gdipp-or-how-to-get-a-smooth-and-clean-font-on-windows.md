Fonts. Fonts, fonts, fonts. I spend all my days to code on Mac OS X at work and when I get back home, I'm so frustrated to have such a fucking font render on my Windows. Of course I have ClearType. But it's really really not enough for me, even with the most tough settings.

Anyway. This is where I found a not-so-bad application which allows you have a kinda Mac OS X render on fonts. This is cool. Yes. It's called [gdipp](http://code.google.com/p/gdipp/), it's free, open source as well and it rocks. I will simply quote it

  The gdipp (codename) project is a replacement of the Windows text render, which brings to you the effect of text like Mac OS and Linux distributions. It is easy to use with ignorable overhead, and it is fully customizable.

Isn't it perfect, aye? Go get some and you'll tell me your feeling.

Some samples there:

* Explorer
