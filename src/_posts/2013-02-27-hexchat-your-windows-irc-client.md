You're on Windows (or Linux) and you probably want to come back or/and use [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat). Well, [HexChat](http://hexchat.org) is your boy. [HexChat](http://hexchat.org) is an [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) client based on [XChat](http://xchat.org/), but unlike [XChat](http://xchat.org/) it's completely free for both Windows and Unix-like systems.

Everything is like [XChat](http://xchat.org/) but better, more updated and free on Windows (other platforms too, for sure). Plus the theme system is really nice. Just [download a theme](http://hexchat.org/themes.html) and it will be packaged with an executable which allows you to easily change your [HexChat](http://hexchat.org) colours.

Have a try!
