I must confess that I'm on Windows 7 at home. Not because I love it or I can't deal without it but because I'm also a drummer, a photographer, a video gamer, and most of these stuff are (unfortunately) on Windows. I hope one day it won't be anymore but for the moment it's the case. Well, it's not my point today. It will be also a future article about how to develop on Windows (yes, it's possible, you will see).

Today, I will talk about [submarine](https://github.com/blazt/submarine), an excellent subtitle seeker. [Submarine](https://github.com/blazt/submarine) allows you to download easily subtitles of your favourite film or series. The command is simple (yes, it's in cli, that's why I love it):

```
$ submarine -l fr *.avi
```

It will search all french subtitles for every avi file. Isn't it great? No stupid gui, no adware, no bullshit; plus it's open source. \o/

### Quick install with Homebrew

```
$ brew tap orpiske/alt
$ brew install submarine
```

### Man

    $ submarine
    Usage:
      submarine [OPTION...] FILE... - download subtitles
