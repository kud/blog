Because [SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) are clean, useful in multi-device environment and sometimes you don't know or have time to design them, it's important to have your own [SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) resources.

This is what I've got. Please, share, do any [PR](https://github.com/kud/blog/) if you know some too.
