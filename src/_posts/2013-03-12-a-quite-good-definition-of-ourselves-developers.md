> As developers, we seem to be hardwired to try to fix things. And once we managed something, we get bored with it and want to automate it so that in the future we don’t have to think about it any longer. We are already pre-occupied with solving the next puzzle. We delude ourselves into thinking that everything can get a process that makes it easier. After all, this is what programming was meant for – doing boring repetitive tasks for us so we can use our brains for things that need more lateral thinking and analysis.

From a quote of [Christian Heilmann](http://christianheilmann.com) (in a [keynote](http://christianheilmann.com/2013/02/20/helping-or-hurting/) that wasn't really the main topic but) I wanted to keep in mind to explain this:

Developers aren't coders. They are solvers and use code to do it.
