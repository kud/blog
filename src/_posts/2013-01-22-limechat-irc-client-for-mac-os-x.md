Nope, [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) ain't dead. Nope, [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/) is not enough. Yes, I'm still and I will still be on [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat). [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) isn't a fashion stuff, [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) is a great protocol to communicate with other people (well at least, geeks). You can receive all supports you need about softwares, libraries, applications, frameworks. It's not dead and won't be because it's still the best way to group lots of people in the same place. Doing that on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/) is like spamming everyone. So, yes, please, come on [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat), mostly [freenode](http://freenode.net/). You won't regret.

Anyway, as any activities on Internet, you must have the best tool to do it. About [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat), it's probably [LimeChat](https://github.com/psychs/limechat) which answers the best to this question.

[LimeChat](https://github.com/psychs/limechat) is an open source [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) client for Mac OS X which gives you everything you need. Plus I know you love themes, themes are available and done in CSS. Yep.

### Bonus for Windows fella

On Windows, I advise you [HexChat](http://www.hexchat.org/) which is a fork of [XChat](http://xchat.org/) but free. (The Windows build of XChat is not free).

Cya there so!
